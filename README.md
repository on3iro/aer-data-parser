## Data parser

This is a simple data parser for [aer-data](https://github.com/on3iro/aer-data).

To run the parser, follow these steps:

1. check out the repository
2. run `yarn` to install all dependencies
3. (optional) check if a newer version of aer-data exists and install it via yarn
4. run `yarn start`

>*NOTE*: The script isn't very sophisticated so there might occur issues with file paths, directories etc.
